Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library for PyTorch.
It consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses PyTorch as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.

**Repository Details:**
This repository helps to understand the basic functionalities of Kornia library, which helps on Computer Vision.
